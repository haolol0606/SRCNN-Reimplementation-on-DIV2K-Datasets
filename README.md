# SRCNN-Reimplementation-on-DIV2K-Datasets

This repository contains a reimplementation of the **SRCNN (Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network)** for image super-resolution, trained and evaluated on **DIV2K Datasets**.  
It is a PyTorch-based implementation that demonstrates high-quality upscaling and performance evaluation with PSNR and SSIM metrics.

## Models

You can download trained SRCNN models (trained on DIV2K (x3 only)) here:

## Features

- Reimplementation of the original SRCNN architecture
- Supports training and testing on **DIV2K Datasets**
- Evaluation with PSNR and SSIM metrics
- Save and load model checkpoints
- Example scripts for training and inference
